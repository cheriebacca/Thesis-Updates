# Introduction

The rapid digitalization of financial services has opened up new opportunities for the adoption of emerging technologies like **cryptocurrency** in the Philippines. Cryptocurrency, with its potential for decentralized, fast, and borderless transactions, has garnered significant attention as a transformative force in the Philippines' financial landscape (Santos & Cruz, 2023). However, widespread adoption remains hindered by concerns surrounding security, usability, and the perceived value of these virtual currencies (Garcia et al., 2024).

This research employs the **Integrated Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM)** framework (Parasuraman & Colby, 2015) to evaluate cryptocurrency adoption intentions in the Philippine context. The study examines four key **technology readiness dimensions** identified by Lin and Chang (2020): **optimism, innovativeness, insecurity,** and **discomfort**. These dimensions are analyzed in relation to two critical factors from the **Technology Acceptance Model** (Davis, 1989): **perceived ease of use** and **perceived usefulness**.

## Main Objective

To analyze the factors influencing the adoption of cryptocurrency among students of Visayas State University using an integrated approach that combines the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).

### Specific Objectives

1.  To **describe** the socio-demographics of Visayas State University students and in relation to their adoption of cryptocurrrency;

2.  To **analyze** the interrelationships between inherent technology readiness, technology acceptance, and perceived risk in the context of virtual currency adoption; and

3.  To **contribute** to policy development by providing insights on the determinants of cryptocurrency adoption.

# Conceptual Framework

As shown in Figure 1, it integrates the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as a whole Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM). This integrated approach combines the rational, performance-oriented perspective of TAM with the psychological readiness dimensions of TRI, added with the variable of perceived risk, offering a comprehensive model for understanding technology adoption.

```

The framework integrates Technology Readiness Index (TRI) dimensions, which represent individuals' psychological predispositions toward technology. These dimensions include Optimism (OPT), Innovativeness (INN), Insecurity (INS), and Discomfort (DIS), which are theorized to influence key Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) constructs like Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) and Perceived Usefulness (PUN) (Parasuraman & Colby, 2015), added with Perceived Risk (PER), and its dependent variable - Behavior Intention to Use (BIU).

# Methodology

## Research Design

To fulfill the objectives of this study, the Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM) employed a quantitative, cross-sectional research design to investigate the factors influencing cryptocurrency adoption intentions among VSU students. A quantitative methodology was adopted, aligned with past research efforts applying TRAM (Godoe, et al., 2012, Simiyu, 2019). This quantitative approach enabled data collection and analysis through a structured closed-ended survey instrument. As emphasized by Cohen et al. (2007), quantitative techniques allow findings from a sample population to be statistically generalized to the wider population. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design provided a snapshot of perceptions and intentions at a specific point in time, enabling efficient data collection while minimizing participant burden. Thus, a quantitative methodology guided by TRAM allows research questions on technology adoption intentions to be reliably measured and projected based on findings from the survey sample. 

## Population and Sampling

### Target Population

The target population for this study comprised undergraduate students enrolled at Visayas State University during the school year 2024-2025. This population was selected due to their demographic profile aligning with early technology adopters and their potential future role in cryptocurrency market development (Kim et al., 2021).

### Sampling Technique

A simple random sampling technique was employed to ensure every student in the target population had an equal and independent chance of being selected for the study. This technique involved generating a complete sampling frame of all enrolled students from the university registry, assigning each student a unique identifier, and using a computer-generated random number algorithm to select participants. This approach eliminated selection bias, enhanced the external validity of findings, and provided a statistically representative sample of the student population (Taherdoost, 2016). Additionally, simple random sampling was specifically chosen because cryptocurrency adoption is a phenomenon that transcends traditional demographic boundaries, and this sampling method allows for the natural emergence of patterns without imposing predetermined stratification that might inadvertently introduce researcher bias about which population segments are most relevant to cryptocurrency adoption (Fowler, 2014).

### Sample Size Determination

A sampling using Cochran’s formula was used to recruit undergraduate students from Visayas State University - Main Campus. The current undergraduate university student population of school year 2024-2025 is 9,846. Using 90% confidence with a 5% margin of error, the recommended sample size is 264 based on Cochran’s formula. Thus, **at least 264 student participants** from Visayas State University were randomly sampled and surveyed.  

## Research Instrument

### Questionnaire Development

The **TRAM survey instrument** consisted of **seven (7) closed-ended questions** of the **Pre-Screening Test portion**, and **forty-eight (48) closed-ended items** combining validated scales from both the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). 

Sociodemographic information collected included age, sex, faculty, year level, and income sources. Technology usage and digital competency measures assessed internet usage habits, digital competency, and familiarity with digital financial tools. Cryptocurrency awareness and experience items captured knowledge of cryptocurrencies, ownership status, and usage patterns. The Technology Readiness Index (TRI), adapted from Parasuraman and Colby (2015), measured optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity dimensions. Technology acceptance measures, adapted from Davis (1989) and Venkatesh et al. (2003), captured perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Perceived risk items, adapted from Featherman and Pavlou (2003), measured financial, performance, and security risk perceptions. Finally, behavioral intention to use items, adapted from Venkatesh et al. (2003), assessed respondents' intentions to adopt cryptocurrency in the near future.

### Scale Measurement

The questionnaire comprised seven (7) parts – the first being the Consent letter, the second being the Sociodemographic Profile, and the third being the Pre-Screening Test. Then, it is followed by twenty-four (24) measurement statements of TRI scored on a 5-point Likert agreement scale (1-Strongly Disagree to 5-Strongly Agree), and twelve (12) measurement scales of TAM scored on a 7-point Likert agreement scale (1-Strongly Unlikely to 5-Strongly Likely). Then, with six (6) measurement scales of Perceived Risk. Lastly, it ended with six (6) measurement statements of behavioral intention to use still on a 7-point Likert agreement scale.

The core TRAM items included 24 statements from TRI encompassing the readiness dimensions of optimism (6 items), innovativeness (6 items), insecurity (6 items), and discomfort (6 items). Additionally, 24 statements were adapted from Davis (1989) and edited for the TAM constructs of perceived ease of use (6 items), perceived usefulness (6 items), perceived risk (6 items), and behavioral intention to use (6 items).

### Instrument Validity and Reliability

To ensure the validity and reliability of the research instrument, several procedures were implemented. 

**Content validity** using Congruence Test was established through review by a panel of two subject matter experts, both from the Faculty of Management and Economics, who assessed the relevance, clarity, and comprehensiveness of the items. 

**Face validity** was addressed through a pilot test with twenty (20) students who matched the target population criteria. Feedback was collected regarding question clarity, questionnaire flow, and completion time. Based on expert reviews and pilot test feedback, the questionnaire was refined by adjusting the length to ensure completion within 15-20 minutes.

## Time and Place of Study

Final data collection were gathered for 17 days, from **March 24, 2025**, to **April 10, 2025**, using the survey questionnaire online. Of the 264 needed respondents, 500 students were distributed with the survey questionnaire on their emails to ensure a robust, usable sample. And instead of just 264, the researcher collected **277 responses** from the random respondents.

## Data Collection Procedures

### Survey Administration

The data collection process ensured comprehensive coverage and reliable data acquisition. Research ethics approval was obtained from the VSU University Ethics Committee prior to commencing data collection. Potential respondents were recruited through requesting data from the school's registrar of the official university email of the students. The questionnaire was primarily administered online using Google Forms to maximize reach and facilitate data management. The survey remained active for seventeen (17) days, from **March 24, 2025**, to **April 10, 2025**.

## Data Analysis Methods

### Descriptive Analysis

Descriptive statistics were computed to characterize the sample and summarize response patterns. The analysis included frequency distributions with counts and percentages for categorical variables, measures of mean for continuous variable (age), and visual representations to illustrate response distributions. 

### Exploratory Factor Analysis

EFA was conducted to examine the underlying structure of the measurement items. Factorability assessment employed Bartlett's test of sphericity and Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy to determine the suitability of the data for factor analysis. Principal axis factoring with verimax rotation was utilized for factor extraction, accommodating the anticipated correlation between factors. Factor retention decisions relied on multiple criteria, including Kaiser's criterion (eigenvalues > 1.0), scree plot examination, parallel analysis, and theoretical coherence. Items with low factor loadings (< 0.50) or high cross-loadings (> 0.40 on multiple factors) were evaluated for potential elimination to refine the instrument.

### Confirmatory Factor Analysis

CFA was performed to validate the measurement model. The factor structure identified in the EFA was specified as a measurement model in lavaan. Model estimation utilized maximum likelihood estimation, with robust corrections for non-normality applied where necessary. The model fit was evaluated using multiple indices, including Chi-square test (χ²/df < 3.0), Comparative Fit Index (CFI > 0.95), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI > 0.95), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA < 0.06), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR < 0.08). Modification indices were examined for potential improvements, with changes implemented only when theoretically justifiable.

### Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling

PLS-SEM was employed as the primary analytical technique for hypothesis testing. 

Measurement model assessment focused on item reliability (standardized indicator loadings > 0.70), internal consistency (composite reliability > 0.70), convergent validity (average variance extracted > 0.50), and discriminant validity (Fornell-Larcker criterion and heterotrait-monotrait ratio). 

Structural model assessment examined path coefficients (direction, magnitude, and statistical significance), coefficient of determination (R²) to evaluate explanatory power, effect size (f²) to assess impact of exogenous constructs, Stone-Geisser's Q² to determine predictive relevance, and variance inflation factor (VIF < 5.0) to check for multicollinearity. 

Significance testing utilized bootstrapping procedure with 5,000 resamples, two-tailed testing at α = 0.05, and 95% confidence intervals for path coefficients. Mediation analysis assessed direct and indirect effects, classified mediation types (full, partial, or none), and tested significance of indirect effects through bootstrapping.

### Software Implementation

All analyses were conducted using R (version 4.1.2) and its specialized packages. 

Data preparation and cleaning utilized tidyverse and naniar packages. Exploratory analysis employed psych and FactoMineR packages. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted with lavaan. PLS-SEM analyses were performed using plspm and semPLS packages. Visualization of results utilized ggplot2, corrplot, and semPlot packages. 

This software ecosystem allowed for reproducible, transparent, and comprehensive data analysis while providing flexibility for advanced statistical modeling.

Based on the **sociodemographic data**, the study surveyed **277 university students** across various faculties, with significantly more **female respondents (163)** than male (101). The average age of the respondents is **21 years old**, given that they are university students. The sample shows **strong representation** from **Management and Economics (22.4%)** and **Agriculture and Food Sciences (20.9%)**, while faculties like Computing (2.2%) have minimal representation. Gender distribution varies notably by faculty - females dominate in Veterinary Medicine (80%) and Natural Sciences (67.6%), while males are predominant in Computing (83.3%). Most respondents were upper-level students, with 31.4% in their fourth year, suggesting a sample with substantial academic experience.

The **financial profile** of respondents reveals they are **overwhelmingly dependent on family support**, with 88.4% citing allowances from family or guardians as their main income source and 46.6% listing it as their secondary source. Educational funding through scholarships serves as the primary income for only 7.6% of respondents but becomes significantly more important as a secondary source (32.9%). Employment income (part-time, full-time, or freelance) contributes minimally to students' financial resources, collectively accounting for just 3.2% of primary income. 

### Internet Usage and Digital Competency

Figure 4.1 illustrates the internet usage habits of respondents, indicating extremely high daily engagement and substantial time spent online. The majority of participants reported daily internet usage (97.1%), with most users (61.0%) spending more than 5 hours online each day. This demonstrates not only the ubiquity of internet access but also its deeply integrated role in daily life, as nearly all respondents engage with online services daily and well over half dedicate significant portions of their day to internet activities. The minimal percentage of occasional users (less than 3% combined for weekly and rare usage) further emphasizes how essential internet connectivity has become for the surveyed population.

Digital competency levels among respondents are presented in Figure 4.2. The data indicate that an overwhelming majority of participants demonstrate high digital literacy, with 97.8% reporting comfort operating digital devices such as smartphones, laptops, or tablets. This exceptional level of digital comfort is complemented by widespread adoption of digital financial services, as 91.7% of respondents have used applications for online transactions including banking and shopping. These findings reveal a population that is not only highly connected, as shown in Figure 4.1, but also confident and experienced in utilizing digital technologies for both general use and specific transactional purposes, suggesting minimal digital divide among the surveyed group.

### Technology Engagement Patterns

Respondents' familiarity with smart tools is depicted in Figure 4.3, revealing a clear hierarchy in digital device adoption and usage patterns. Smartphones dominate as the primary technology tool with nearly universal adoption (99.3%), establishing them as the cornerstone of digital engagement among participants. Laptops represent the second most commonly used device at 59.6%, suggesting that while most respondents rely on multiple devices, approximately 40% operate primarily through mobile technology. Tablets show moderate adoption at 19.5%, while smartwatches remain at an early adoption stage with only 8.7% regular usage. This distribution indicates a mobile-first technology landscape where portable, always-connected devices are prioritized, with decreasing adoption rates for secondary and peripheral smart tools.

### Cryptocurrency Awareness and Ownership

Figures 4.4 and 4.5 present data on cryptocurrency awareness and ownership among participants, respectively. Analysis revealed that 93.5% of respondents reported awareness of cryptocurrencies, while only 12.3% indicated ownership of at least one form of cryptocurrency. The awareness data shows varying levels of familiarity, with the majority (65.0%) acknowledging awareness but admitting limited knowledge, while 28.5% claim to be familiar with cryptocurrencies. Despite this high level of awareness, the significant gap between awareness (93.5%) and actual ownership (12.3%) suggests that cryptocurrencies remain primarily in the awareness phase rather than adoption phase for most respondents. This indicates potential barriers to cryptocurrency adoption despite widespread recognition of its existence in the digital economy.

Figure 4.6 illustrates the distribution of specific cryptocurrencies owned by participants, with Bitcoin being the most commonly held (21.6%), followed by Ethereum (18.9%). The data reveals a clear preference for established cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum together accounting for over 40% of cryptocurrency ownership among respondents. The "Others" category represents a significant portion (16.2%), suggesting diversification beyond the top-listed options. Mid-tier cryptocurrencies show moderate adoption, with XRP at 10.8%, while Tether, Solana, and Binance Coin each represent 6.8% of ownership. Less commonly held cryptocurrencies include Dogecoin (5.4%), Cardano (4.1%), and Toncoin (2.7%), demonstrating a long-tail distribution pattern where ownership becomes increasingly fragmented among alternative coins.

The primary motivations for cryptocurrency ownership are presented in Figure 4.7. The most frequently cited reasons included investing and trading (72.5%), gaming and metaverse applications (15.0%), and payments and purchases (7.5%), suggesting that cryptocurrencies are predominantly viewed as investment vehicles rather than functional currencies. The overwhelming preference for investment and trading purposes indicates that most cryptocurrency owners are motivated by potential financial returns rather than practical utility. The emerging use cases in gaming and metaverse environments represent a significant secondary motivation, pointing to growing integration with digital entertainment ecosystems. Meanwhile, the relatively low percentages for payments, remittances, and long-term holdings (collectively accounting for just 12.5%) demonstrate that cryptocurrency's original purpose as an alternative payment system remains a secondary consideration for most current adopters.

Optimism toward cryptocurrency was generally moderate among respondents, with approximately 35-37% expressing moderate to strong agreement (ratings 4-5) with positive statements about cryptocurrency's benefits. This suggests a cautiously positive outlook rather than overwhelming enthusiasm. The heatmap reveals that across all dimensions of cryptocurrency optimism, the most common response was neutral (rating 3), consistently representing 40-55% of responses. The highest level of positive sentiment was observed regarding cryptocurrency's independence from traditional banking hours, with 37% agreeing or strongly agreeing with this benefit. Respondents were least convinced about cryptocurrency delivering on their expectations, with only 21% expressing strong confidence. 

The substantial neutral responses indicate many respondents remain undecided about cryptocurrency's practical advantages, reflecting a population that acknowledges potential benefits but maintains reservations about fully embracing this technology for their financial activities.

```

Regarding innovativeness, the distribution of responses shows a tendency towards agreement, with most respondents choosing 3 (Neutral) and 4 (Agree) across all items. This indicates that respondents generally perceive themselves as moderately innovative in the context of cryptocurrency adoption. They believe they can understand and use cryptocurrency with some independence and keep up with developments, though few strongly consider themselves as experts.

```

Perceptions of insecurity related to technology revealed a distribution leaning towards neutrality (3) and slight agreement (4), indicating moderate feelings of insecurity among respondents. This suggests that while respondents do not strongly believe cryptocurrency is unreliable or overly complex, they are not entirely confident in its security and usability either.

Discomfort with technology manifested as a pattern of moderate agreement (3 and 4) across most items, suggesting that respondents experience a mix of uncertainty and caution when using cryptocurrency. This may indicate concerns about transaction reliability, privacy, and the need for human support over automated systems.


### Technology Acceptance Dimensions

The technology acceptance model dimensions—perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use — were similarly analyzed using stacked horizontal bar charts (Figures 4.12-4.13).

```

Analysis of perceived usefulness revealed that most respondents view cryptocurrency positively in terms of enhancing their financial activities, with the majority selecting neutral to slightly favorable responses (levels 3 and 4). Across all statements, a consistent proportion clustered around these mid-to-high agreement levels—particularly the belief that cryptocurrency enhances effectiveness, which had the highest proportion at level 3 (0.53). While fewer respondents strongly agreed (level 5), the low proportion of strong disagreement suggests limited resistance to the idea. This pattern indicates a general but cautious optimism toward cryptocurrency’s usefulness, reflecting moderate confidence rather than strong conviction in its financial advantages.

```

Regarding perceived ease of use, respondents indicated a generally favorable view, with the majority selecting level 3 (neutral) and level 4 (agree) across all statements. Notably, statements such as “I believe that cryptocurrency instructions are clearer and understandable to me” and “I believe that I find it easy to follow instructions with cryptocurrency to accomplish my transactions” had high proportions at level 3 and 4, suggesting moderate confidence in the usability of cryptocurrency. The relatively low percentages at the extremes (strongly disagree and strongly agree) reflect a cautious but overall positive perception, indicating that while respondents do not find cryptocurrency difficult to use, they may still be building familiarity and comfort with it.

### Perceived Risk

Figure 4.14 presents the distribution of responses related to perceived risk associated with cryptocurrency adoption.

  geom_text(aes(label = round(Proportion, 2)), 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5, reverse = TRUE), 
            size = 4, color = "black") +  
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "1" = "#f7fbff", 
      "2" = "#deebf7", 
      "3" = "#c6dbef", 
      "4" = "#9ecae1", 
      "5" = "#6baed6", 
      "6" = "#3182bd", 
      "7" = "#08519c"
    ),
    labels = c(
      "1", 
      "2", 
      "3", 
      "4", 
      "5", 
      "6", 
      "7"
    )
  ) +  
  coord_flip() +  
  scale_x_discrete(labels = question_labels) +  
  labs(
    title = "PERCEIVED RISK",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Proportion (Decimal Form)",
    fill = "1: Extremely Unlikely - 7: Extremely Likely"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.title = element_blank(),

    legend.spacing.x = unit(0.5, 'cm')
  ) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title.position = "top", title.hjust = 0.5, nrow = 1))

```

The data indicate a moderate to high perception of risk associated with cryptocurrency use, with a notable concentration of responses around levels 4 to 7, particularly in statements concerning financial risk. The highest proportions in level 7 (extremely likely) appear in items like “I believe that using cryptocurrency involves a high level of financial risk” and “I feel that the lack of regulation increases the uncertainty,” reflecting significant apprehension. This suggests that while some users recognize potential benefits of cryptocurrency, concerns regarding security, regulation, and personal data protection remain prominent barriers to full acceptance.

### Behavioral Intention to Use

Respondents' behavioral intention to use cryptocurrencies is depicted in Figure 4.15.

            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5, reverse = TRUE), 
            size = 4, color = "black") +  
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(

  ) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title.position = "top", title.hjust = 0.5, nrow = 1))

```

Analysis reveals a moderate level of intention to use cryptocurrencies among respondents, with the largest proportion consistently selecting neutral to slightly positive responses (scores 3-5). Approximately 25-28% of respondents indicate higher likelihood of adoption (scores 4), while stronger commitment (scores 6-7) remains relatively low at 8-14%. Notably, respondents show similar patterns across all six intention statements, suggesting consistent but cautious interest in cryptocurrency adoption. This moderate enthusiasm may indicate that while many see potential value in cryptocurrencies, significant barriers to widespread adoption remain, including concerns about volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and technical complexity that prevent stronger behavioral commitments.

## Correlation Analysis

To examine the relationships among key constructs prior to more sophisticated analyses, a correlation matrix was generated (Table 4.2). The matrix reveals significant positive correlations between Behavioral Intention to Use and several facilitating factors, including Perceived Usefulness (0.585), Perceived Ease of Use (0.587), Optimism (0.571), and Innovativeness (0.514). Additionally, notable associations exist between risk factors, with Discomfort and Insecurity showing a moderate correlation (0.562), suggesting these constructs may represent related dimensions of cryptocurrency hesitancy.

```

Of particular interest are the significant correlations between Perceived Usefulness and both Optimism (0.721) and Perceived Ease of Use (0.574), indicating that practical utility perceptions are closely linked to technological optimism and usability assessments. The negative correlations between Perceived Risk and facilitating factors (Innovativeness: -0.267; Perceived Ease of Use: -0.193) further support the conceptual model's proposition that risk perception serves as a key barrier to cryptocurrency adoption. These relationships provide preliminary support for several of the hypothesized linkages in the conceptual model.

## Exploratory Factor Analysis

### Assessment of EFA Appropriateness

Prior to conducting the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the appropriateness of the data for factor analysis was evaluated using multiple criteria.

```{r}

# Create a new dataset with only column 17 and beyond
df_subset <- df_final[, 17:ncol(df_final)]


# BARTLETT TEST
BARTLETT(df_subset, N= nrow(df_subset))

```

Bartlett's test of sphericity yielded a chi-square value of 12475.18 (df = 1128, p < .001), indicating that the correlation matrix was significantly different from an identity matrix. This suggests sufficient intercorrelations among the variables for factor analysis.

```{r}

# KAISER-MEYEN-OLKIN (KMO Test)
KMO(df_subset)

```

The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was 0.932, exceeding the recommended threshold of 0.60 and indicating that the proportion of variance in the variables might be caused by underlying factors, thus supporting the factorability of the correlation matrix. Individual KMO values for variables ranged from 0.772 to 0.970, with the majority above 0.90, further confirming excellent sampling adequacy across all measurement items.

```{r}

# Exploring possible factors

# KAISER-GUTTMAN CRITERION
KGC(df_subset, eigen_type = "EFA")

```

**Figure 4.16.** ***Scree Plot from Exploratory Factor Analysis***

```{r}

# SCREE TEST
scree(df_subset)

```

The scree plot (Figure 4.16) suggests the retention of approximately 6-8 factors based on the notable elbow in the curve. The first two factors demonstrate substantially higher eigenvalues (approximately 17 and 8, respectively), followed by a gradual decrease in subsequent factors. After the eighth factor, the curve flattens considerably, indicating minimal additional variance explained by retaining more factors. This pattern aligns with Kaiser's criterion of retaining factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0, while also considering the theoretical structure of the measurement instrument.

**Figure 4.17.** ***Parallel Analysis Scree Plot***

```{r}

# PARALLEL TEST
fa.parallel(df_subset, fa = "fa")

```

The parallel analysis scree plot (Figure 4.17) provided further guidance on factor retention, suggesting that six factors should be retained. This determination is based on the intersection points between the actual data eigenvalues (blue line with triangles) and the simulated/resampled data eigenvalues (red dashed line). Only those factors whose eigenvalues from the actual data exceed the corresponding eigenvalues from the simulated random data are considered meaningful. This parallel analysis approach offers a more rigorous statistical criterion for factor extraction compared to traditional methods, reinforcing the decision to proceed with a six-factor solution in subsequent analyses.


### Factor Structure

Based on the factor retention criteria, six factors were extracted. Table 4.3 presents the factor loadings matrix after rotation. The factor structure demonstrates clear differentiation among constructs with minimal cross-loading. Factor 1 (ML2) represents Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU) with strong item loadings ranging from 0.806 to 0.828. Factor 2 (ML3) comprises Discomfort (DIS) items with loadings between 0.678 and 0.818. Factor 3 (ML1) captures Perceived Risk (PER) items with loadings from 0.584 to 0.643. Factor 4 (ML4) represents Perceived Usefulness (PUN) with robust loadings between 0.709 and 0.790. Factor 5 (ML5) reflects Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) with consistent loadings from 0.714 to 0.753. Factor 6 (ML6) captures Optimism (OPT) with solid loadings between 0.668 and 0.686. Cumulatively, these six factors explain 64.5% of the total variance, with the first factor alone accounting for 25.4% of variance.

**Table 4.3.** ***Factor Loadings Matrix***

```{r}

# Factor Interpretation

# Factor Extraction
# fa_unrotated <- fa(r = df_subset, nfactors = 7, rotate = # "none")
# print(fa_unrotated$loadings)

# df_subset <- df_subset |> select(-ins5, -ins6)

# Factor Rotation
fa_varimax <- fa(r = df_subset, nfactors = 7, rotate = "varimax", fm = "ml")
print(fa_varimax$loadings, sort = TRUE, cutoff = 0.4)

```

The factor loadings matrix reveals a clear six-factor structure with strong psychometric properties. Each item loaded predominantly on its intended factor with minimal cross-loading, supporting excellent construct validity. Factor 1 (ML2) represents Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU) with loadings ranging from 0.806 to 0.828. Factor 2 (ML3) captures Discomfort (DIS) with loadings between 0.678 and 0.818. Factor 3 (ML1) comprises Perceived Risk (PER) items loading from 0.584 to 0.643. Factor 4 (ML4) represents Perceived Usefulness (PUN) with loadings between 0.709 and 0.790. Factor 5 (ML5) measures Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) with loadings from 0.714 to 0.753. Finally, Factor 6 (ML6) captures Optimism (OPT) with loadings between 0.668 and 0.686. Together, these six factors explain 64.5% of the total variance, with factor 1 alone accounting for 25.4%. The clean factor structure provides strong empirical support for the hypothesized measurement model, with no problematic items requiring removal.

**Table 4.4.** ***Coefficient Matrix***

```{r}

# Factor Interpretation and Respecification
# Fix the pipe syntax - either use correct dplyr syntax or direct assignment
fa_varimax_scores_rounded <- round(fa_varimax$scores, 7)
head(fa_varimax_scores_rounded) # Use head() instead of tibble() if df_subset isn't properly set up for tibble


```

The coefficient matrix (Table 4.4) provides further insight into the relationships between observed variables and latent factors, indicating moderate correlations between factors. Notable correlations exist between Factor 1 (BIU) and Factor 5 (PEU) at 0.588, as well as between Factor 1 (BIU) and Factor 6 (OPT) at 0.571, confirming the conceptual relationships between behavioral intentions, perceived ease of use, and optimism toward cryptocurrencies. The moderate negative correlation between Factor 3 (PER) and Factor 1 (BIU) (-0.246) reinforces the theoretical expectation that higher perceived risk negatively influences intention to use.

## Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM)

### Assessment of Measurement Model

The measurement model was evaluated to ensure reliability and validity before proceeding to structural model assessment. Table 4.5 presents the assessment results for the measurement model.

**Table 4.5.** ***Assessment of PLS-SEM Measurement Model***

```{r}

# Step 1: Define the measurement model using multi_items function
measurement_model <- constructs(
  composite("DIS", multi_items("dis", 1:6)),
  composite("PER", multi_items("per", c(1, 2, 3, 6))),  
  composite("BIU", multi_items("biu", 1:6)),
  composite("PUN", multi_items("pun", 1:6)),
  composite("PEU", multi_items("peu", 1:6)),
  composite("INN", multi_items("inn", 1:6)),
  composite("OPT", multi_items("opt", 1:6))
)

# Step 2: Define the structural model
structural_model <- relationships(
  paths(from = "OPT", to = c("PUN", "PEU")),
  paths(from = "INN", to = c("PUN", "PEU")),
  paths(from = c("DIS", "PER"), to = c("PUN", "PEU")),
  paths(from = "PEU", to = "PUN"),
  paths(from = c("PUN", "PEU"), to = "BIU")
)

# Step 3: Estimate the PLS-SEM model
pls_model <- estimate_pls(
  data = df_subset,
  measurement_model = measurement_model,
  structural_model = structural_model
)

# Step 4: Get summary of results
pls_model_summary <- summary(pls_model)

```

```{r}


# Bootstrapping the PLS-SEM model
boot_pls_model <- bootstrap_model(seminr_model = pls_model, nboot = 100)
boot_pls_model_summary <- summary(boot_pls_model, alpha = 0.10)
  
```

```{r}

plot(boot_pls_model$measurement_model)

```

### Validity and Reliability Analysis

Table 4.6 provides a more detailed examination of the validity and reliability indicators for each construct in the measurement model.

```{r}

DT::datatable(pls_model_summary$reliability %>% round(3))

```

```{r}

plot(pls_model_summary$reliability)

```

The analysis confirms that all constructs meet the established criteria for reliability and convergent validity, with excellent psychometric properties across all measurement scales.

The Cronbach's alpha values range from 0.877 to 0.964, well above the recommended threshold of 0.7, indicating high internal consistency reliability for all constructs. 

Composite reliability (rhoC) values are similarly impressive (0.896 to 0.971), further confirming strong reliability. 

Convergent validity is demonstrated by AVE values ranging from 0.591 to 0.847, all exceeding the minimum acceptable value of 0.5, with most constructs showing particularly strong values above 0.7. The Discomfort (DIS) construct shows the lowest AVE (0.591), though still acceptable, suggesting slightly more measurement error compared to other constructs. 

The unusually high rhoA value for DIS (1.153) is notable and may indicate some multicollinearity among its indicators, warranting closer examination, though this doesn't compromise the overall measurement quality given all other metrics are satisfactory.

### Discriminant Validity

Discriminant validity was assessed using two approaches: the Fornell-Larcker criterion and the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio of correlations.

**Table 4.7.** ***Fornell-Larcker Criterion for Discriminant Validity***

```{r}

DT::datatable(pls_model_summary$validity$fl_criteria %>% round(3))

```

The Fornell-Larcker criterion (Table 4.7) demonstrates that the square root of the AVE for each construct (diagonal elements) exceeds the correlations with other constructs (off-diagonal elements), supporting discriminant validity.

**Table 4.8.** ***Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) Ratio***

### Heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT)

```{r}

DT::datatable(pls_model_summary$validity$htmt %>% round(3))

```

The HTMT ratios (Table 4.8) all fall below the conservative threshold of 0.85, providing additional evidence of discriminant validity between the constructs.

### Multicollinearity Assessment

Multicollinearity was assessed using variance inflation factors (VIF), as presented in Table 4.9.

**Table 4.9.** ***Variance Inflation Factors (VIF)***

```{r}

pls_model_summary$vif_antecedents

```

All VIF values are below the critical threshold of 5.0, ranging from 1.659 to 2.047, indicating that multicollinearity is not a concern in the structural model.

### PLS-SEM Bootstrapped Estimation

To assess the significance of the measurement model parameters, a bootstrapping procedure with 5,000 resamples was conducted.

```{r}

## bootstrapping constructs pls-sem model
boostrap_pls_model <- 
  bootstrap_model(
    seminr_model = pls_model, 
    nboot = 100, 
    seed = 20231
)


## bootstrapped summary
boostrap_pls_model_summary <- summary(boostrap_pls_model, alpha = 0.10)

```

```{r}

plot(boostrap_pls_model)

```

**Table 4.10.** ***Bootstrapped Factor Loadings***

```{r}

DT::datatable(boot_pls_model_summary$bootstrapped_loadings %>% round(3))

```

The bootstrapped factor loadings (Table 4.10) confirm the statistical significance of all indicator loadings, with t-values exceeding 1.96 (p < 0.05) and ranging from 4.043 to 131.076.

### Path Analysis Results

The structural model's path coefficients were evaluated to test the hypothesized relationships between constructs. Table 4.11 presents the path estimates, including standardized coefficients, t-values, p-values, and confidence intervals.

**Table 4.11.** ***Path Estimates from PLS-SEM Analysis***

```{r}

DT::datatable(boot_pls_model_summary$bootstrapped_paths %>% round(3)) 

```

## Summary of Hypothesis Testing

Based on the PLS-SEM analysis, Table 4.12 summarizes the results of the hypothesis testing.

```

Of the eleven (11) hypotheses tested, seven (7) were supported by the data, while four (4) were not supported. These are the following:

**Significant Paths**

***Optimism (OPT) to Perceived Ease of Use (PEU)***

This significant positive relationship indicates that students with higher levels of technology optimism perceive cryptocurrencies as easier to use.

***Optimism (OPT) to Perceived Usefulness (PUN)***

This strong positive relationship suggests that optimistic attitudes toward technology substantially enhance perceptions of cryptocurrency usefulness, representing the strongest effect among all paths.

***Innovativeness (INN) to Perceived Ease of Use (PEU)***

Personal innovativeness has a significant positive effect on perceived ease of use, suggesting that students who are more innovative with technology find cryptocurrencies easier to use.

***Innovativeness (INN) to Perceived Usefulness (PUN)***

Interestingly, this significant negative relationship indicates that more innovative students perceive cryptocurrencies as less useful, which contradicts typical technology adoption patterns and warrants further investigation.

In other words, higher innovativeness is associated with lower perceived usefulness, which contradicts the original positive direction proposed in the hypothesis.

This unexpected negative relationship suggests that more innovative individuals might actually perceive cryptocurrencies as less useful, perhaps due to higher standards or more critical evaluation of the technology's current practical applications.

***Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) to Perceived Usefulness (PUN)***

This strong positive relationship confirms the Technology Acceptance Model's core proposition that technologies perceived as easier to use are also perceived as more useful.

***Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) to Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU)***

This significant positive relationship demonstrates that perceived ease of use directly influences students' intentions to adopt cryptocurrency.

***Perceived Usefulness (PUN) to Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU)***

This strong positive relationship indicates that perceived usefulness has a substantial direct effect on cryptocurrency adoption intentions, and this effect is stronger than that of perceived ease of use.

**Non-Significant Paths**

***Discomfort (DIS) to Perceived Ease of Use (PEU)***

The confidence interval includes zero, indicating that technology discomfort does not significantly affect how easy students perceive cryptocurrencies to be.

***Discomfort (DIS) to Perceived Usefulness (PUN)***

Technology discomfort does not significantly influence perceptions of cryptocurrency usefulness.

***Perceived Risk (PER) to Perceived Ease of Use (PEU)***

Perceived  risk has no significant impact on ease of use perceptions.

***Performance Risk (PER) to Perceived Usefulness (PUN)***

Performance risk concerns do not significantly affect usefulness perceptions.

# Key Findings

The results reveal that **optimism** and **innovativeness** (positive dimensions of Technology Readiness) are the **strongest predictors** of **perceived ease of use** and **perceived usefulness** of cryptocurrencies. Contrary to expectations, technology innovativeness shows a negative relationship with perceived usefulness, suggesting that more innovative students may be more critical or realistic about cryptocurrency's practical value.

The Technology Acceptance Model's core relationships are confirmed, with perceived ease of use positively influencing perceived usefulness, and both constructs significantly affecting behavioral intention to use cryptocurrencies. Perceived usefulness demonstrates a stronger effect on behavioral intention (0.408) compared to perceived ease of use (0.322), indicating that **practical utility is more important than simplicity in driving cryptocurrency adoption among university students**.

Notably, the inhibiting factors of Technology Readiness (discomfort and performance risk) did not significantly influence either perceived ease of use or perceived usefulness, suggesting that **concerns about technology complexity or performance may not be major barriers to cryptocurrency adoption in this population**.
