# Introduction

The rapid digitalization of financial services has opened up new opportunities for the adoption of emerging technologies like **cryptocurrency** in the Philippines. Cryptocurrency, with its potential for decentralized, fast, and borderless transactions, has garnered significant attention as a transformative force in the Philippines' financial landscape (Santos & Cruz, 2023). However, widespread adoption remains hindered by concerns surrounding security, usability, and the perceived value of these virtual currencies (Garcia et al., 2024).

This research employs the **Integrated Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM)** framework (Parasuraman & Colby, 2015) to evaluate cryptocurrency adoption intentions in the Philippine context. The study examines four key **technology readiness dimensions** identified by Lin and Chang (2020): **optimism, innovativeness, insecurity,** and **discomfort**. These dimensions are analyzed in relation to two critical factors from the **Technology Acceptance Model** (Davis, 1989): **perceived ease of use** and **perceived usefulness**.

## Main Objective

To analyze the factors influencing the adoption of cryptocurrency among students of Visayas State University using an integrated approach that combines the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).

### Specific Objectives

1.  To **describe** and compare the socio-demographics of Visayas State University students and in relation to their adoption of cryptocurrrency, within the context of an integrative framework combining the Technology Readiness Index (TRI) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM);

2.  To **analyze** the interrelationships between inherent technology readiness (as measured by TRI) and perceived usefulness and ease of use (as measured by TAM) in the context of virtual currency adoption; and

3.  To **contribute** to policy development by providing insights on the determinants of cryptocurrency adoption, which can inform strategies for promoting responsible use and regulation of digital currencies in academic and broader contexts.

```

```{r}
# Function to calculate count and percentage within each variable
categorical_summary_208 <- function(data, variable) {
  data %>%

    mutate(Percentage = round(100 * n / sum(n), 1),
           Summary = paste0(n, " (", Percentage, "%)")) %>%
    rename(Category = !!sym(variable)) %>%
    mutate(Variable = variable) %>%
    select(Variable, Category, Summary)
}

# Process categorical variables separately
categorical_variables_208 <- c("sex", "year_level", "faculty", "main_income", "sec_income")

categorical_table_208 <- bind_rows(lapply(categorical_variables_208, function(var) categorical_summary_208(df_208, var)))

# For Gen Z (18-28 years old)
genz_table <- df_208 %>%
  filter(age >= 18 & age <= 28) %>%
  summarise(
    Min = min(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max = max(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean = round(mean(age, na.rm = TRUE), 2),
    SD = round(sd(age, na.rm = TRUE), 2)

```

## Visualization of Sociodemographic factors

```{r}
ggplot(df_208, aes(x = age, fill = ..count..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black", alpha = 0.9) +  # Fill intensity based on count
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution", x = "Age", y = "Frequency") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(df_208$age), max(df_208$age), by = 1)) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "skyblue", high = "navyblue") +  # Gradient from light to dark
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14), 
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "none"  # Remove legend for cleaner look
  )

```

```{r}
# Bar Graph for Sex
ggplot(df_208, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) +  
  geom_bar(color = "black", alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("mediumorchid", "navyblue", "coral")) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Sex Distribution", x = NULL, y = "Count") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),  
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),  
    legend.position = "right" 
  )

```

The sex distribution of respondents indicates that the majority are female, followed by male respondents. A small portion of participants preferred not to disclose their sex. This suggests a slightly higher female representation in the sample.

```{r}
# Bar Graph for Year Level
ggplot(df_208, aes(x = factor(year_level), fill = factor(year_level))) +
  geom_bar(color = "black", alpha = 0.9) +  # Bar chart with border
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Year Levels",
       x = "Year Level",
       y = "Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightblue", "skyblue", "steelblue", "royalblue","dodgerblue", "navyblue")) +  # Custom colors
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "none"  # Hide legend since x-axis labels are sufficient
  )

```

The distribution of year levels shows that the majority of respondents are 4th-year students, followed equally by 3rd-year and 2nd-year students, then the number of 1st-yr students come into close. Finally, there are fewer participants from 5th-year and 6th-year levels, indicating that 4th-year students are more represented in the sample.

```{r}
# Bar Graph for Faculty
ggplot(df_208, aes(x = faculty, fill = faculty)) +  
  geom_bar(color = "black", alpha = 0.8) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "lightcoral", "mediumseagreen", 
                               "gold", "orchid", "cadetblue", "tomato", 
                               "darkseagreen", "khaki", "plum")) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Faculty Distribution", x = NULL, y = "Count") +  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),  
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),  
    legend.position = "right" 
  )

```

The distribution of respondents across faculties shows that the Faculty of Management and Economics has the highest number of participants, followed by the Faculty of Agriculture and Food Sciences and the Faculty of Natural and Mathematical Sciences. The Faculty of Computing has the fewest respondents, indicating a lower representation from that group.

```{r}

# Bar Graph for Main Source of Income
df_clean_208 <- df_208 |>  filter(main_income != "N/A") 

ggplot(df_clean_208, aes(x = main_income, fill = main_income)) +  
  geom_bar(color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +  
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightblue", "skyblue", "steelblue", "royalblue","dodgerblue", "navyblue")) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Main Source of Income", x = NULL, y = "Count") +  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),  
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),  
    legend.position = "right" 
  )

```

The majority of respondents rely on allowances from family or guardians as their main source of income, while a small portion depends on scholarships or educational grants. This suggests that financial support from family remains the primary means of sustaining students' expenses.

```{r}
# Bar Graph for Secondary Source of Income
df_clean_208 <- df_208 |>  filter(sec_income != "N/A") 

ggplot(df_clean_208, aes(x = sec_income, fill = sec_income)) +  
  geom_bar(color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +  
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightblue", "skyblue", "steelblue", "royalblue","dodgerblue","darkblue", "navyblue")) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Secondary Source of Income", x = NULL, y = "Count") +  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),  
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),  
    legend.position = "right" 
  )

```

The majority of respondents still receive allowances from family or guardians as their secondary source of income. However, a notable number also rely on scholarships or educational grants, while a smaller portion earns through freelance/self-employed. This indicates that while family support remains significant, some students seek additional financial resources through scholarship or work.

## Visualization of Technology and Cryptocurrency Familiarity factors

### Internet Usage Habits

```{r}
# Bar Graph for Internet Usage Frequency
df_summary_IUH_208 <- df_208 %>%
  count(internet_freq, internet_hours)

# Create enhanced grouped bar plot
ggplot(data = df_summary_IUH_208, aes(x = internet_freq, y = n, fill = internet_hours)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +  # Add border to bars
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "royalblue","dodgerblue","darkblue")) +  # Use custom colors
  labs(title = "Internet Usage Frequency and Duration",
       x = "Internet Frequency",
       y = "Number of Respondents",
       fill = "Internet Hours") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  # Increase base font size
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16),  # Center & bold title
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.5),  # Improve x-axis labels
    legend.position = "top",  # Move legend to top for better visibility
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold")  # Bold legend title
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5, size = 5)  # Add count labels


```

The vast majority of participants (202 respondents) report daily internet usage, with 133 of them spending more than 5 hours online each day, representing nearly 64% of the total sample. Another 46 respondents use the internet daily for 3-5 hours, while 21 spend 1-3 hours daily and only 2 use it for less than 1 hour per day. In stark contrast, just 3 respondents report using the internet rarely (all for 3-5 hours when they do), and only 1 person indicates weekly internet use (for more than 5 hours).

These findings overwhelmingly demonstrate that **daily, extensive internet usage is the norm among this population**, with over 85% of respondents spending at least 3 hours online every day.

### Digital Competency

```{r}
# Bar Graph for Digital Competency

# Summarize counts
df_summary_DC_208 <- df_208 %>%
  count(digital_comf, online_trans)

# Create bar plot
ggplot(df_summary_DC_208, aes(x = digital_comf, y = n, fill = online_trans)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +  
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "navyblue")) +  
  labs(title = "Digital Competency and Online Transactions",
       x = "Digital Competency",
       y = "Number of Respondents",
       fill = "Online Transactions") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16),  
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0.5),  
    legend.position = "top",  
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold")  
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5, size = 5)  

```

The overwhelming majority of participants (204 individuals, or 98% of respondents) report having digital competency, with most of these digitally competent individuals (190 respondents, or 93% of the total sample) also engaging in online transactions. Only 14 digitally competent respondents (7%) report not conducting online transactions despite their digital skills. Among the small minority who lack digital competency (just 4 respondents, or 2% of the sample), 3 individuals still don't participate in online transactions, while surprisingly, 1 respondent reports conducting online transactions despite lacking digital competency.

This data demonstrates an **extremely strong correlation between digital competency and online transaction behavior**, suggesting that digital literacy is nearly universal among the respondents and serves as a key enabler for online commercial activity.

### Familiarity with Smart Tools

```{r}

# Bar Graph for Familiarity with Smart Tools
df_208 %>%
  separate_rows(smart_usage, sep = ", ") %>%
  count(smart_usage) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(smart_usage, n), y = n, fill = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.6, color = "black") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "navyblue", guide = "none") +  # Remove legend
  labs(title = "Familiarity with Smart Tools",
       x = "Smart Tool",
       y = "Number of Respondents") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5, size = 12),  # Center x-axis labels
    axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold")
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5, size = 5)

```

Smartphones dominate as the most familiar device with 206 respondents (99% of the sample) indicating familiarity with them. Laptops follow as the second most familiar smart tool, with 129 respondents (62%) reporting familiarity. Tablets rank third with 45 respondents (22%) being familiar with them, while smartwatches show the lowest familiarity rate at only 19 respondents (9%). The data reveals a clear hierarchy in smart device familiarity, with nearly universal smartphone adoption but significantly lower familiarity with wearable technology like smartwatches.

This pattern suggests that while **mobile communication technology has reached near-complete penetration** among the respondents, newer categories of smart devices have not yet achieved the same level of familiarity or adoption.

### Cryptocurrency Awareness

```{r}

# Bar Graph for Cryptocurrency Awareness
df_summary_208 <- df_208 |> 
  count(crypto_aware)

ggplot(df_summary_208, aes(x = reorder(crypto_aware, -n), y = n, fill = crypto_aware)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +  # Add count labels
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Awareness Level", values = c(
    "Yes, I am familiar with cryptocurrencies." = "navyblue",
    "Yes, but I don't know much about them." = "steelblue",
    "No, I have never heard of cryptocurrencies." = "red"
  )) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Cryptocurrency Awareness",
       x = NULL,
       y = "Count") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),  
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "right"
  )

```

The largest group, comprising 130 respondents (62.5% of the sample), indicates basic awareness of cryptocurrencies but limited knowledge ("Yes, but I don't know much about them"). Meanwhile, 62 respondents (29.8%) report being familiar with cryptocurrencies ("Yes, I am familiar with cryptocurrencies"), suggesting a deeper understanding of the topic. Only 16 respondents (7.7%) indicate complete unfamiliarity with cryptocurrencies ("No, I have never heard of cryptocurrencies").

These findings demonstrate that while cryptocurrency awareness is widespread among the survey population (92.3% have at least heard of cryptocurrencies), a significant knowledge gap exists, with less than a third of respondents claiming actual familiarity with the technology. This pattern suggests that while **most respondents recognize cryptocurrencies as a concept**, there remains substantial opportunity for education about their functionality and applications.

### Cryptocurrency Ownership

```{r}

# Clean and handle 'None'
df_clean_208 <- df_208 |> 
  mutate(crypto_own2 = ifelse(is.na(crypto_own2) | crypto_own2 == "NA", "None", crypto_own2))

# Split multiple selections
df_long_208 <- df_clean_208 |> 
  separate_rows(crypto_own2, sep = ",") |> 
  mutate(crypto_own2 = trimws(crypto_own2)) |>  # Clean spaces
  filter(crypto_own2 != "None") |>              # Remove "None"
  group_by(crypto_own2) |> 
  summarise(n = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  as.data.frame()

# Plot updated graph
ggplot(df_long_208, aes(x = reorder(crypto_own2, -n), y = n, fill = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "navyblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Cryptocurrency Ownership Count",
       x = "Cryptocurrency",
       y = "Number of Owners") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 45, hjust = 1),  # Rotate for readability
    legend.position = "none"
  )


```

Bitcoin (BTC) emerges as the most popular cryptocurrency with 13 owners, followed by Ethereum (ETH) with 10 owners and XRP/Ripple with 7 owners. Tether (USDT) has 4 owners, while Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL) each have 3 owners. Less common cryptocurrencies are each owned by just 1 respondent.

This ownership pattern reflects the broader cryptocurrency market capitalization hierarchy, with the most established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum having the highest adoption rates, followed by altcoins of decreasing market prominence. Overall, the data indicates that while **cryptocurrency ownership exists among respondents**, it represents a **relatively small subset of the current total 208 survey participants**, with Bitcoin ownership representing just 6.25% of the total sample.

### Cryptocurrency Uses

```{r}

#Cryptocurrency Uses
# Filter out N/A, NA, None, and irrelevant entries
df_clean_208 <- df_208 %>%
  filter(!is.na(crypto_what)) %>%
  filter(!crypto_what %in% c("N/A", "NA", "None", 
                             "NFTs, Trading Shitcoins and sometimes scalping altcoins"))

# Summarize counts
df_summary_208 <- df_clean_208 %>%
  count(crypto_what)

# Plot the filtered chart
ggplot(df_summary_208, aes(x = reorder(crypto_what, -n), y = n, fill = crypto_what)) +  
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +  
  geom_text(aes(label = n), vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("steelblue", "lightcoral", "mediumseagreen", "darkseagreen")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Cryptocurrency Uses", x = NULL, y = "Count") +  
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 14),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "right"
  )


```

Investment and trading activities overwhelmingly dominate as the primary use case, with 19 respondents (approximately 73% of cryptocurrency users) employing cryptocurrencies for this purpose. Gaming and metaverse applications represent the second most common usage, reported by 5 respondents (19% of users). Long-term holding and payments/purchases are each utilized by just 1 respondent, representing only about 4% of cryptocurrency users for each category.

This distribution strongly suggests that **investment and trading** remain the **predominant motivation for cryptocurrency ownership** among the survey participants, with utility-based applications like gaming and payments being significantly less common. When considered alongside the previous cryptocurrency ownership data, these findings indicate that roughly 13% of the total 208 survey respondents own cryptocurrencies, with investment and trading being the primary motivation for approximately 9% of the entire sample.

## Technology Readiness

This stacked bar chart depicts respondents' levels of optimism regarding various aspects of cryptocurrency technology.

For each statement measuring optimism toward cryptocurrency benefits, the majority of respondents selected the middle option (3 on the scale), indicating a predominantly neutral stance.

The statement with the highest level of agreement is "Using cryptocurrency gives me more control over my financial activities," with 120 respondents (58%) choosing the neutral option and 51 respondents (24%) expressing some level of agreement. Similarly, statements about cryptocurrency delivering expectations and utilizing the latest financial technologies received moderately positive responses. The aspect with the most skepticism appears to be regarding cryptocurrency offering freedom and flexibility in financial activities, with 70 respondents (34%) expressing some level of disagreement.

Overall, the visualization reveals a **cautious optimism** among the survey participants, with most maintaining a neutral position while slightly more respondents lean toward agreement than disagreement across all cryptocurrency benefit statements. This suggests that while **respondents recognize potential advantages of cryptocurrency technology**, **widespread strong enthusiasm remains limited**.

The stacked bar chart illustrates respondents' behavioral intentions regarding cryptocurrency usage across several dimensions. Unlike the previous risk perception chart, this visualization shows a distinct skew toward disagreement, indicating limited intention to adopt or continue using cryptocurrency. The statement showing the strongest disagreement is "I intend to use/continue cryptocurrency for my financial transactions in the near future," with 22 respondents strongly disagreeing and 26 disagreeing (levels 1-2), while only 44 strongly agree and 49 agree.

Similarly low intention appears regarding cryptocurrency adoption as a payment method, with 27 respondents strongly disagreeing and 28 disagreeing that they will likely use cryptocurrency as a payment means in the coming year. The commitment to incorporating cryptocurrency into financial routines shows comparable resistance, with 32 strongly disagreeing and 33 disagreeing, versus 38 strongly agreeing and 48 agreeing.

The most neutral response pattern appears in the general statement about expecting to actively engage with cryptocurrency, with 77 respondents selecting the middle option. However, even here, there are more respondents expressing disagreement (75 total) than agreement (56 total).

Overall, this visualization reveals **significant hesitation regarding future cryptocurrency adoption**, with most statements showing more disagreement than agreement. This aligns with the strong risk perceptions seen in the previous chart and suggests that despite some recognition of potential usefulness, the perceived risks and usability challenges appear to outweigh benefits for many respondents, resulting in limited intention to engage with cryptocurrency going forward.

The correlation matrix presents Spearman correlation coefficients for factors of Technology Readiness and Technology Acceptance.

The data reveals several significant relationships among the eight variables examined. **Behavioral Intention to Use (BIU)** demonstrates **moderate positive correlations** with **Perceived Ease of Use (0.557)**, **Perceived Usefulness (0.545)**, and **Optimism (0.531)**, suggesting these factors positively influence adoption intentions.

The psychological constructs show interesting interconnections as well. **Perceived Risk** **correlates positively** with both **Discomfort (0.646)** and **Insecurity (0.553)**, indicating these negative perceptions tend to cluster together. Meanwhile, **Perceived Ease of Use** **strongly correlates** with **Perceived Usefulness (0.554)** and **Innovativeness (0.593)**, highlighting how these constructs reinforce each other.

**Optimism** emerges as an important factor, showing **substantial positive correlations** with **Perceived Usefulness (0.686)**, **Innovativeness (0.544)**, and **Behavioral Intention to Use (0.531)**. This suggests that an optimistic outlook significantly enhances perceptions of technology value and adoption intentions. Notably, **Perceived Risk** shows **negative correlations** with most positive factors, particularly with **Innovativeness (-0.23)** and **Perceived Ease of Use (-0.174)**, demonstrating how risk perception can undermine positive technology assessments.
